ReDi-School - Introduction to Computer Science Spring 2023- Final Project

                    ---- Check if it´s a vetch! ----

# Intro

This project was developed in June 2023 as the final project of the Course
Introduction to Computer Science by Redi-School. The Course took place for
about 12 weeks. 
It was my first coding project ever, so please be lenient towards me and my
code. I guess that there is a much more easier and cleaner way of coding,
but at least it´s working and I am glad that I was able to find a solution
for the following project:

# The Challenge

At my garden in early spring I was asking myself how to put diffenrent vegetables 
togehter.
There is this permaculture theorie that plants, in this case vegetables,
benefit each other by keep pests at bay, attract beneficial insects and help 
pollinate by atracting bumblebees and bees.
For example: Onions like carrots but doesn´t like peas.
             Peas like carrots but doesn´t like onions.
             Carrots like Onions and Peas.
             So arrangement should be with carrots in the middle.

It took me a while to sort out how to arrange 7 or 8 different vegetables 
by internet search. So I decided to write a program for it.

# The Code

The code is writen in HTML, CSS and Phyton (and little Javascript). I used VSCode and the flask framework to render my page and Beautiful Soup for 
web-sraping for data. I split the code in two pices, one for web-scraping for data and one for the functionality connected to each other by a json file.

# Execute

Run the "get_data_prdc_dict.py" file. Then execute the "user_input_and_function.py" file. Enter your vegetables at the html-page and check if it´s a vetch!

# To do´s for improving the code and resumee 

Expand the logic and the result to show a correct result if a input is mispelled or empty and
Resolve other bugs. 
Rework the HTML-page with responsive design.
Improve the code to get a more clean and readable code.

# Thanks

Thanks to Redi-School and the teachers and my classmates!
